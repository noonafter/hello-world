# hello-world

Hi Everyone!

I'm noonafter, I'm a machine learning amateur.
I like programming though I have so many chores to do in my daily life.

After reading the tutorial of github, I summarize the three most important concepts of Github: Repository, Branch, Pull request.

Respository represents the project and contains all the project files.

Branch is the copy of the definitive version which allows you to edit on the project files.

Pull request is assosiated with Branch, after you edit some files, you can commit these changes into others' branches.
